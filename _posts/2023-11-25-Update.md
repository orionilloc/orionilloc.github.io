# Where have I been?
I ought to explain what I have been up to for the last year. I hope someone might read this and feel encouraged by my notes. I’m still very much in my early career, and it will be interesting to look back at this post in a couple years.

I decided to pay for TryHackMe's annual plan, thanks to a Black Friday discount. My goal is to spend a couple hours per week exploring the platform. Other platforms like LetsDefend, HackTheBox, BlueTeamLabs, or CyberDefenders are more expensive and require a bigger time commitment. You can feel guilty paying for a service if you don’t actively use it. I haven’t fully exhausted TryHackMe’s resources yet, and last year I was fairly active, even maintaining a streak beyond 180 days.

Before posting more challenge write-ups, I wanted to share something more personal. I’ve often avoided putting my thoughts online. Most modern blogs are SEO-driven, and the “content” is usually buried under layers of promotion or irrelevant advice. That has influenced how I perceive online writing. Growing up on the cusp of anonymity, I was used to a world where you could have a persona online that didn’t fully match your real life. I’ve always enjoyed lurking, unseen. So putting my thoughts here feels slightly risky but also exciting, like giving life to a static site I built through GitHub workflows.


# Significant life changes
## Obtained my first IT job
When I first applied to jobs, most screener calls were for tier 1 positions starting around $40,000. That felt far below market, especially considering benefits. But after a month of searching, I found a position that’s engaging, fairly compensated, and gives me meaningful work. I interact directly with end-users and tackle projects that matter, not just tickets in a queue. My managers are responsive and foster growth by giving me interesting work. Burnout hasn’t been an issue yet.

Most of our clients are tech startups or VC-backed firms, with almost no on-prem equipment. Their infrastructure is cloud-hosted, with only networking or access-control hardware on-site. It’s a hybrid role with flexibility to work from home, though I prefer going to the office. A fifteen-minute commute makes that easy. Overall, it’s been a great fit, and I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had.

## Got out of a four-year relationship
This year also brought some personal shifts. My four-year relationship ended. That slowed some of my professional development outside of work hours. Even when pursuing hobbies or learning new skills, energy and focus can be limited after a breakup. I’ve spent more time exploring music, reflection, and creative outlets. In a way, this has reinforced that personal growth and professional growth are deeply intertwined.

I will definitely say that this has been a great time to listen to new music. Besides holding a trove of ecclesiastical music, a sizeable chunk of Western music is centered on lost love. So I guess I've got that going for me.


# Going forward

## Maxims
- Be reliable and competent; mistakes happen, but repeated inattention erodes trust.
- Communicate your interest in projects, tasks, and technologies to management.
- Learn from the people you admire and aim to become dependable for those who can mentor or elevate you.
- Document troubleshooting steps and project work for easy reference and handoff.
- Manage your time thoughtfully, using short breaks and movement to maintain energy.
- Understand that some projects take variable time- sometimes hours at once, sometimes spread across weeks.
- Ask for guidance on priorities when uncertain.
- Communication beats isolation; stay engaged with your team.
- Don’t let work define your identity or happiness.
- IT is more people-oriented than it appears; problem-solving often includes interpersonal skills.

## Career trajectory

I’d like to stay in this role for a couple of years. The raises have been consistent, and I’ve gained exposure to interesting projects: explaining IAM roles to DevOps leads, advising on network builds, and guiding software installations.

I’ve read many long-term career retrospectives, and a recurring theme is: don’t let a role lock you away from what you want to pursue. Rather than just completing tasks to get better at them, focus on learning that excites you. I’m prioritizing Linux, scripting, automation, and security, which is why I renewed TryHackMe. I’m moving toward more hands-on work that aligns with my interests.

I wish anyone reading this the best, whether it’s today or a few years from now. Keep exploring, stay curious, and enjoy the process.
