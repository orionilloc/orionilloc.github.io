After a few years of starting, stopping, and life happening (including my previous breakup, heh), I finally earned my [AWS Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certification.

From May to August, I really focused. I reengaged with Adrian Cantrill’s course and Stephane Maarek’s course, and spent some quality time with Joe Bonso’s practice exams through Tutorials Dojo. I made close to around 1000 individual Anki flashcards.

A couple hours some days, a little repetition, a lot of “aha” moments. Labs and exercises finally clicked, and certain AWS concepts started making sense. I still had a few practice exams left across my learning platforms, but I pushed to complete the official exam before September.

I found it quite agonizing to wait 5-6 hours for my results, as I didn't feel particularly confident about my exam, even though nothing on the exam was unfamiliar. Seeing the AWS Certifications and Credly emails come through really elevated my Friday mood. I would have liked a better score, but that's okay.

It’s a reminder that even if life gets messy, dedicating consistent time to something meaningful pays off. The certification might not immediately get me new employment, but it strengthens my understanding and confidence. For now, I plan on building lab environments to continue reinforcing and applying what I’ve learned so that I can continue moving along in my career. I hope to share these here as well!
