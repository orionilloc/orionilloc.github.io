I’m an early-to-mid career sysadmin and security professional with a focus on blue-team operations and cloud architecture. I recently earned my AWS Solutions Architect – Associate certification and previously held Cisco CCNA and CompTIA Security+ certifications.

This site serves as a hub for technical write-ups, including TryHackMe and HackTheBox challenges, as well as personal projects, lab builds, and career reflections. In the future, I hope to expand into malware analysis, reverse engineering, and digital forensics.
